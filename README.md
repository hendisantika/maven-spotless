# maven-spotless

In the context of a Maven project, **Spotless** refers to a Maven plugin that helps developers enforce consistent code
formatting and style across their codebase. It is particularly useful for maintaining clean, readable, and standardized
code by automating tasks like formatting, cleaning up imports, and applying code style rules.

### Key Features of Spotless:

1. **Code Formatting**: Automatically formats your source code according to predefined or custom rules.
2. **Linting**: Can check for style violations without modifying the code (dry-run mode).
3. **Support for Multiple Languages**: Works with Java, Kotlin, Scala, XML, JSON, and more.
4. **Integration with Popular Formatters**: Supports tools like Google Java Format, Eclipse Formatter, Prettier, and
   others.
5. **Custom Rules**: Allows you to define custom formatting rules if needed.
6. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Can be integrated with Git hooks to ensure code is formatted before commits.

### Why Use Spotless in a Maven Project?

- **Consistency**: Ensures that all developers on a team follow the same coding standards.
- **Automation**: Reduces manual effort by automating formatting tasks.
- **Improved Code Reviews**: Minimizes discussions about formatting during code reviews, allowing teams to focus on
  logic and functionality.
- **Error Prevention**: Helps catch formatting issues early in the development process.

### How to Add Spotless to a Maven Project

To use Spotless in your Maven project, you need to add the `spotless-maven-plugin` to your `pom.xml`. Below is an
example configuration:

```xml

<build>
   <plugins>
      <!-- Spotless Maven Plugin -->
      <plugin>
         <groupId>com.diffplug.spotless</groupId>
         <artifactId>spotless-maven-plugin</artifactId>
         <version>2.27.0</version> <!-- Use the latest version -->
         <configuration>
            <java>
               <googleJavaFormat>
                  <version>1.15.0</version> <!-- Specify the version of Google Java Format -->
                  <style>GOOGLE</style> <!-- Options: GOOGLE, AOSP -->
               </googleJavaFormat>
               <removeUnusedImports/>
               <indent>
                  <spaces>true</spaces> <!-- Use spaces instead of tabs -->
               </indent>
            </java>
         </configuration>
      </plugin>
   </plugins>
</build>
```

### Common Commands for Spotless

Once the plugin is configured, you can use the following Maven commands to interact with Spotless:

1. **Apply Formatting**:
   This command formats your code according to the rules defined in the configuration.
   ```bash
   mvn spotless:apply
   ```

2. **Check Formatting**:
   This command checks if the code adheres to the formatting rules without modifying it. Useful in CI/CD pipelines.
   ```bash
   mvn spotless:check
   ```

3. **Clean Formatting**:
   Removes any formatting applied by Spotless.
   ```bash
   mvn spotless:clean
   ```

### Example Use Case

Imagine a team working on a large Java project. Without a tool like Spotless, developers might use different IDE
settings, leading to inconsistent formatting (e.g., some use tabs, others use spaces). By integrating Spotless into the
Maven build process, the team can ensure that all code follows the same style, reducing friction during code reviews and
improving overall code quality.

### Additional Notes

- **Custom Formatter Configurations**: You can provide custom formatter configurations (e.g., `.editorconfig`,
  `.prettierrc`) to tailor Spotless to your project's needs.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Spotless can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines to enforce formatting rules during builds,
  ensuring that only properly formatted code is merged into the main branch.

By using Spotless, you can streamline your development workflow and maintain a high standard of code quality in your
Maven projects.
